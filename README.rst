ReEntry Vehicle Tutorial - Python Version
=========================================

This is a Python implementation of the Re-Entry Vehicle Glyph scripting
tutorial, found in the standard Tutorial Workbook that is installed with
Pointwise. It generates an extruded structured block around a contrived
periodic re-entry vehicle shape.

A few minor deviations from the original Tcl script have been
made to illustrate some of the more 'pythonic' aspects of the `Glyph Client
for Python`_.
